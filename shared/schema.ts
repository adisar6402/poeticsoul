You chose him over and over again wiping your harsh words at my heart glued with the echoes of I was not a better man to walk down with at the Freetown

Yet I had no choice but to clap with my tears, heart, and feet leaving with many buried words aside from my hot breath burning my lungs I once exhaled with you beneath the seawater,

Distant memories I could think of you while I searched and learned to stop loving you seeking myself right in the setting of the sunrise we once looked together Dreaming!!`,

Being beaten by the harsh weather of rainfall,
Sunlight,
Thirsty lungs breathing high to hold my heart,

The journey never seems to come to an end while my feet hurt looking lost in the middle of the miles I've covered!!`,

Bold gesture amidst the chaos right fitted together with the suit and tie,

A place of better steps to move on with the linings of the Dreams!!`,

I stand in the mirror reflecting no one but myself precisely seeking a new dawn to lose my past together with the tears,

But my difference put behind my past to love wholeheartedly like a soul whose heart has never been broken before giving a glimmering light in my heart to not look for myself in you,

Yet I hold onto my feelings despite it too hard for me to accept we can't be together while I can't help but to wonder if it's could just be a nightmare but is my reality standing in between my Heart!!`,
