Yet I had no choice but to clap with my tears, heart, and feet leaving with many buried words aside from my hot breath burning my lungs I once exhaled with you beneath the seawater,

Distant memories I could think of you while I searched and learned to stop loving you seeking myself right in the setting of the sunrise we once looked together Dreaming!!`,

But my difference put behind my past to love wholeheartedly like a soul whose heart has never been broken before giving a glimmering light in my heart to not look for myself in you,

Yet I hold onto my feelings despite it too hard for me to accept we can't be together while I can't help but to wonder if it's could just be a nightmare but is my reality standing in between my Heart!!`,
